### OrangeHRM Project

The Orange HRM project involves testing the People Information Management (PIM) module which typically handles employee data such as personal details, employment history, and performance evaluations within the Orange HRM system. In this project, you'll be creating, updating, and deleting employee records through the PIM module using automated tests implemented with TestNG, Maven, Selenium, and Jenkins.

Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **TestNG**: TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language inspired by JUnit and NUnit. It supports various annotations for defining test methods, test suites, and setup/teardown operations. You'll use TestNG to structure and execute your test cases for the PIM module.

2. **Maven**: Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, building, and packaging Java applications. You'll use Maven to manage project dependencies, compile source code, and execute tests in a streamlined and standardized manner.

3. **Selenium**: Selenium is a popular open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It provides a suite of tools for web application testing across different browsers and platforms. You'll use Selenium WebDriver, the primary component of Selenium, to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and verify the behavior of the PIM module's user interface.

4. **Jenkins**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It allows automating the building, testing, and deployment of software projects. You'll use Jenkins to schedule and execute your automated tests for the PIM module at regular intervals or in response to specific events.

To implement the project:

- Set up your development environment with TestNG, Maven, Selenium WebDriver, and Jenkins.
- Write test cases to create, update, and delete employee records through the PIM module.
- Implement Selenium WebDriver scripts to automate the execution of these test cases.
- Integrate your Selenium tests with TestNG for structured test execution.
- Configure Jenkins to execute your automated tests periodically or triggered by specific events such as code commits.
- Monitor test results and analyze any failures reported by Jenkins to identify and fix issues in the PIM module.

By combining these technologies and practices, you can efficiently automate testing for the Orange HRM project's PIM module, ensuring its reliability and functionality across different scenarios and environments.
